title: Someday is Today
---

My father died before my 2nd birthday. 

My mother, just about the time I would have graduated from college. 

My one sibling, my brother? He died just over a year ago. 

### Today, I have decided, is Someday.

The day I stop making excuses, and stop kicking the proverbial can down the road, until "Someday". 

Until I have that WordPress site setup *just so*. Until I have *everything figured out*. 

In case that first paragraph wasn't clear enough, life is short. Carpe diem.
